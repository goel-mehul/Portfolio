                <h2>Shiny App for Homeless statistics</h2>
                <p>This shiny app is created to analyze the number of homeless people in the US. After my analysis, I found why some 
                  states like California and Florida have a higher rate of homelessness when compared to other states. I also worked 
                  on finding potential solutions and non-profit organisations that are working towards helping reduce the number of 
                  homeless people. The app contains visualizations of datasets to spread awareness about the continuous increments 
                  in homelessness.

                <p>This figma app is created to help users become aware about the dangers of increasing carbon footprint as well as to
                   calculate their daily carbon footprint amounts and help them set carbon footprint goals. The app uses a secondary 
                   device to calculate the amount of carbon ootprint that gets emmitted from a user's house and their lifestyle and 
                   automatically presents them on the app for the user to keep track on. The app also provides personalized solutions 
                   to help users work on reducing their carbon footprint levels.
